This Repo is about to react things which I have just started learning again the basics. How you can without JSX you can write react code.
## In the Index.html file
I have just initiated the root element and injected CDN react links.                                    
Note - This is not a good approach to inject CDN Links in your Html body. It is also a one-way to do that but not recommended when you are building any projects.
## In the App.js file 
In this file, you may see the react code. You can say to react that it is root element.
